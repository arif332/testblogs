# Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD)

Recently, I have completed Certified Kubernetes Application Developer ([CKAD](https://www.cncf.io/certification/ckad/)) certification of [The Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org). Here are a few tips for the exam which might help you as well to crack the same exam.



## Vi / Vim setting for yaml file to edit comfortably & efficiently

Added few setting in .vimrc profile which help to edit yaml file effectively and efficiently. 

```bash
cat <<EOF>~/.vimrc
set ts=2 sw=2 sts=2 et ai number
syntax on
EOF

Or may be follow below procedure:
echo "set ts=2 sts=2 sw=2 et number" >> ~/.vimrc
source ~/.vimrc
```

While copying part of yaml from kubernetes.io site, enable past mode first using `:set past` which will keep source formatting. 

Disable paste mode by using command: `:set nopaste` in vim command mode. Again turn on auto intendation mode using `:set ai`.

To indent multiple line, go to appropriate line and press `:shift+v` and select required line using `up/down` arrow keys. Then to indent the marked lines press  `>`or `<` and to repeat same action use `.`.



## Command Alias

Used below command alias to type command quickly and check various resources in a single command for a namespace. 

```bash
cat <<EOF>kalias.sh
alias k="kubectl"
alias kgn="kubectl get node" 
alias aa='kubectl get all,sa,ep,sc,pv,pvc,cm,netpol'
alias kn='kubectl config set-context --current --namespace '
alias kcc='kubectl config get-contexts'

export do="--dry-run=client -o yaml" o="-o wide" y="-o yaml" l="--show-labels" r="--recursive"

source <(kubectl completion bash)
complete -F __start_kubectl k
EOF

source kalias.sh
```



## Tmux Setting

Tmux is a great tool but I havn't used because copy and paste method is different than the normal termal. Also time is ticking and need to move quickly to answer all the questions.....



## Book Mark kubernetes.io

In my bookmark manager, added necessary sample yaml from kubernetes.io site so that I could check content quickly when it is required. 



## Lab Practice

At the end, do a lot practice in your lab which will help to answer most of the question in the exam. 



* Use imperative command to create skeleton for pod or deployment and then modify/add extra parameters
* Use imperative command to expose service
* Use bash search command `ctl+r`to run previously executed command.





# Appendix

## Frequenly Use vi/vim commands

```bash
w ==> jump by start of words
4w >> jump muultiple word
e ==> jump by end of words
3e>> multiple at a time
b ==> jump backward by words
0 ==> (zero) is to jump to the start of the line
$ ==> (dollar) jumps to end of line
gg ==> to go to top of page
G ==> to go to bottom of page
dd ==> delete current line
y ==> yank/copy current line
P ==> paste content before cursor
p ==> paster content after cursor
i ==> enter insert mode to input text in current cursor location
a ==> enter insert mode and move cursor to append to the existing line
u ==> undo last action
. ==> (dot) to repeat last command
Ctrl + r ==> redo last action
v ==> to visually select multiple lines


:5 ==> go to 5th line in the file
:N ==> go to Nth line in the file
/search_text ==> search for search_text
n ==> repeat search in same direction
:%s/old_text/new_text/g ==> replace all old_text with new_text throughput file
:%s/old_text/new_text/gc ==> replace all old_text with new_text throughput file asking for confirmation before making each change
:set et ==> set expandtabs to spaces
:set number ==> show line numbers
:set sw=2 ==> shiftwidth of tab from default 8 to 2 spaces
:set ts=2 ==> set tabstop to 2 spaces
:set sts ==> set softtabstop to 2 spaces
```
