            "title": "Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) Exam Preparation Tips",
            "content": "Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) . Recently, I have completed Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) certification of The Linux Foundation. Here are a few tips for the exam which might help you as well to crack the same exam. . Vi / Vim setting for yaml file to edit comfortably &amp; efficiently . Added few setting in .vimrc profile which help to edit yaml file effectively and efficiently. . cat &lt;&lt;EOF&gt;~/.vimrc set ts=2 sw=2 sts=2 et ai number syntax on EOF Or may be follow below procedure: echo &quot;set ts=2 sts=2 sw=2 et number&quot; &gt;&gt; ~/.vimrc source ~/.vimrc . While copying part of yaml from kubernetes.io site, enable past mode first using :set past which will keep source formatting. . Disable paste mode by using command: :set nopaste in vim command mode. Again turn on auto intendation mode using :set ai. . To indent multiple line, go to appropriate line and press :shift+v and select required line using up/down arrow keys. Then to indent the marked lines press &gt;or &lt; and to repeat same action use .. . Command Alias . Used below command alias to type command quickly and check various resources in a single command for a namespace. . cat &lt;&lt;EOF&gt;kalias.sh alias k=&quot;kubectl&quot; alias kgn=&quot;kubectl get node&quot; alias aa=&#39;kubectl get all,sa,ep,sc,pv,pvc,cm,netpol&#39; alias kn=&#39;kubectl config set-context --current --namespace &#39; alias kcc=&#39;kubectl config get-contexts&#39; export do=&quot;--dry-run=client -o yaml&quot; o=&quot;-o wide&quot; y=&quot;-o yaml&quot; l=&quot;--show-labels&quot; r=&quot;--recursive&quot; source &lt;(kubectl completion bash) complete -F __start_kubectl k EOF source kalias.sh . Tmux Setting . Tmux is a great tool but I havn’t used because copy and paste method is different than the normal termal. Also time is ticking and need to move quickly to answer all the questions….. . Book Mark kubernetes.io . In my bookmark manager, added necessary sample yaml from kubernetes.io site so that I could check content quickly when it is required. . Lab Practice . At the end, do a lot practice in your lab which will help to answer most of the question in the exam. . Use imperative command to create skeleton for pod or deployment and then modify/add extra parameters | Use imperative command to expose service | Use bash search command ctl+rto run previously executed command. | . Appendix . Frequenly Use vi/vim commands . w ==&gt; jump by start of words 4w &gt;&gt; jump muultiple word e ==&gt; jump by end of words 3e&gt;&gt; multiple at a time b ==&gt; jump backward by words 0 ==&gt; (zero) is to jump to the start of the line $ ==&gt; (dollar) jumps to end of line gg ==&gt; to go to top of page G ==&gt; to go to bottom of page dd ==&gt; delete current line y ==&gt; yank/copy current line P ==&gt; paste content before cursor p ==&gt; paster content after cursor i ==&gt; enter insert mode to input text in current cursor location a ==&gt; enter insert mode and move cursor to append to the existing line u ==&gt; undo last action . ==&gt; (dot) to repeat last command Ctrl + r ==&gt; redo last action v ==&gt; to visually select multiple lines :5 ==&gt; go to 5th line in the file :N ==&gt; go to Nth line in the file /search_text ==&gt; search for search_text n ==&gt; repeat search in same direction :%s/old_text/new_text/g ==&gt; replace all old_text with new_text throughput file :%s/old_text/new_text/gc ==&gt; replace all old_text with new_text throughput file asking for confirmation before making each change :set et ==&gt; set expandtabs to spaces :set number ==&gt; show line numbers :set sw=2 ==&gt; shiftwidth of tab from default 8 to 2 spaces :set ts=2 ==&gt; set tabstop to 2 spaces :set sts ==&gt; set softtabstop to 2 spaces .",

            "content": "About . This notebook is a demonstration of some of capabilities of fastpages with notebooks. . With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code .
